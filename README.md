# MacAttack

MacAttack is a GUI tool for brute-force attacking IPTV stalker portals. These portals can be found in many IPTV sharing groups across platforms like [Telegram](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22t.me%22%20telegram+iptv+mac+portal), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptvglory/), and [other places](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2200%3A1A%3A79%22+%22%2Fc%2F%22). The portal links typically end in `/c/`. 

While many MAC addresses shared in groups are often banned, this tool is designed to find unshared MAC addresses. If the page title says `stalker_portal` when you open the link in your browser, it should work with MacAttack.
