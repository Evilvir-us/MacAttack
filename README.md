# MacAttack

MacAttack is a GUI tool designed for **testing your own IPTV stalker portals**. This tool is **not for hacking purposes**. It helps you understand how hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in your portals. 

> **Note:** Only use MacAttack on portals you own or have explicit permission to test.

---

## Overview

IPTV stalker portals are commonly shared in IPTV groups across platforms like [Telegram](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22t.me%22%20telegram+iptv+mac+portal), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptvglory/), and other forums. These portal links typically end in `/c/`.

MacAttack helps identify unshared and accessible MAC addresses in these portals. If a portal's page title reads `stalker_portal` when opened in your browser, it can likely be tested with this tool. Keep in mind that some providers secure their portals using device serial numbers, which prevents brute-forcing.
