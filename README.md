# MacAttack

MacAttack is a GUI tool designed for **testing and brute forcing your own IPTV stalker portals**. This tool is **not for hacking purposes**. It helps you understand how hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in your portals. 

> **Note:** Only use MacAttack on portals you own or have explicit permission to test.

---

## Overview

IPTV stalker portals are commonly shared in IPTV groups across platforms like [Telegram](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:%22t.me%22%20telegram+iptv+mac+portal), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptvglory/), and [other forums](https://www.google.com/search?q="00%3A1a%3A79"+"%2Fc%2F"). These portal links typically end in `/c/`.

MacAttack helps identify unshared and accessible MAC addresses in these portals. If a portal's page title reads `stalker_portal` when opened in your browser, it can likely be tested with this tool. 

---

## Requirements
- Windows version 8 or higher.
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html) 64bit version.

## Usage Instructions

Testing stalker portals can take varying amounts of time depending on the portal. Here's how to use the tool effectively:

---

### **MacAttack Tab**
For testing portal security:

1. Navigate to the **Proxies** tab.  
   - Enable proxies.  
   - Populate the proxy list with valid proxies.  

2. Go to the **MacAttack** tab.  
   - Enter your portal's URL in the provided box.  
   - Set the desired speed (1-100).  

3. Click **Start** to begin the test.

> **Note:** It is not recommended to use a VPN and proxies simultaneously. The VPN may interfere with proxy sessions, preventing the expected results. Choose one or the other: either enable the VPN and disable proxies, or enable proxies and disable the VPN.

### **Mac VideoPlayer Tab**
*A modification of the open source project [IPTV-MAC-STALKER-PLAYER](https://github.com/Cyogenus/IPTV-MAC-STALKER-PLAYER)*\
For accessing and testing playlists:

1. Enter your portal's URL in the first box.  
2. Input the MAC address in the second box.
